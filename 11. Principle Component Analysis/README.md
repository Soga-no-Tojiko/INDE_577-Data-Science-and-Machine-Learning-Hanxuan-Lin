# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique that is useful for the compression and classification of data. The purpose is to reduce the dimensionality of a data set (sample) by finding a new set of variables, smaller than the original set of variables, that nonetheless retains most of the sample's information. By information we mean the variation present in the sample, given by the correlations between the original variables. The new variables, called principal components (PCs), are uncorrelated, and are ordered by the fraction of the total information each retains.

# Data & Aim

We will use the wine datasets again. Since it has 13 attributes, we are going to see how many principle components would be included after decomposition, and how much variance could be explained by the PCs.
