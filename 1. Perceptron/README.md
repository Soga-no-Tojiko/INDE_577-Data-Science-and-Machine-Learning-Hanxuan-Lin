# Perceptron(Single Layer)

A perceptron is a neuron that receives inputs and produce an output. Basically a linear regression model is a kind of perceptron. The structure of perceptron includes an input layer, a hidden layer, an activation function and an output layer. The activation function(ReLU, Sigmoid) transform numerical values onto a binary space of {0,1} in the case of perceptron.

# Data

We will use ...

# Aim

We would use a single layer perceptron model to predict the default condition of each loan borrower.
