# Regression Neurons

A single layer perceptron can not only be applied to classification problems, but also solve regression problems with the help of gradient descent. This is how regression neurons work.

# Datasets

For simplicity, we would continue to use the wine datasets and pick one type of wine from it for implementing the algorithm.

# Aim

Using regression neurons to solve a regression problem.
