# Regression Neurons

A single layer perceptron can not only be applied to classification problems, but also solve regression problems with the help of gradient descent. This is how regression neurons work.

# Datasets

For simplicity, we would generate a random datasets that has a linear upward trend for implementing the algorithm.

# Aim

Using regression neurons to solve a regression problem.
